# 📧 Notification System Documentation

## Overview

The LeadsFlow notification system sends emails to users based on their individual notification preferences. Users can control which types of notifications they receive through the Settings page.

## 🎛️ User Notification Settings

Users can configure the following notification types in **Settings > Notifications**:

### Email Notifications
- **New Leads** - Notified when a new lead is added
- **Follow-ups** - Notified when leads are updated or follow-up reminders are due
- **Hot Leads** - Notified when a lead is marked as "Hot"
- **Conversions** - Notified when a lead is converted to a customer
- **Daily Summary** - Receive daily summary reports
- **Email Notifications** - Master toggle for all email notifications

### Push Notifications
- **Browser Push** - Receive browser push notifications (future feature)

## 📧 Email Notification Types

### 1. New Lead Notification

- **Setting**: `newLeads`

### 2. Lead Update Notification
- **Trigger**: When a lead is updated
- **Subject**: "Lead Updated - LeadsFlow"

### 3. Lead Conversion Notification

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. User Settings Check
Before sending any notification, the system checks the user's notification preferences:

```typescript
// Check if user has enabled specific notification type
private async shouldSendNotification(userId: string, notificationType: keyof UserNotificationSettings): Promise<boolean> {
  const settings = await this.getUserNotificationSettings(userId);
  
  // Check if email notifications are globally enabled
  if (!settings.emailNotifications) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Check specific notification type
  return settings[notificationType] || false;
}
```

### 2. Notification Flow
1. **Event Occurs** (e.g., new lead created)
2. **Get User Settings** - Fetch user's notification preferences
3. **Check Permission** - Verify if user wants this type of notification
4. **Send Email** - If permitted, send the notification
5. **Log Result** - Record success/failure

### 3. Default Behavior
- If no user settings are found, notifications are **enabled by default**
- If `emailNotifications` is disabled, **no emails are sent**
- Individual notification types can be toggled independently

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Script
Run the notification test script:

```bash
node test-notifications.cjs
```

This will test all notification types and send sample emails.

### Manual Testing
1. **Go to Settings** - Configure your notification preferences
2. **Create/Update Leads** - Trigger notifications through normal usage
3. **Check Email** - Verify notifications are received (check spam folder)
